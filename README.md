# Honest-Weather
The honest weather app.

Small project I worked on in early 2015. This was a small android app that I worked on that would take your gps location and give you an honest description of what the weather was.

This project was my first dabble into using rest APIs. 
I stopped this project in mid-late 2015 to pursue some other cool ideas.

If you have any questions let me know. This code was written a long time ago when I was still learing the basics but I would be happy to share.
